          <h1>ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIGINS<h1>
            <p>
             From selling waters and sodas at garage sales in Kindergarten, to becoming a Youtube Partner at the age of 13; entrepreneurship is something I've always been passionate about.
              <br></br>
              At age 13, I was earning significant ad revenue from my Youtube gaming videos. This was also the time I began dabbling in applications like Photoshop, After Effects, Sony Vegas, and Cinema 4D. I met a lot of people through that Youtube experience, and managed to even garner clients for freelance graphic design work. 
              <br></br>
              I didn't realize it at the time, but this is age I leveled up in the entrepreneurship world - creating paid content and custom design work for other Youtubers in the space. 
            </p>

        <div class="q1">
           <h1>THE NEXT STEP<h1>
            <p>
             My next big step in entreprenuerialism was opening up my own ecommerce clothing store, called Ryno's Tees, at the age of 18.
              <br></br>
              I was always messing around in Adobe applications and one day I decided to put my designs on some tees and get them printed. A couple friends told me they wanted to buy the tees off me, so I decided why not open up a store online, and see if other people around the world would want to buy my designs too.
              <br></br>
              I got my first online sale within the first few days of my products being up. And today, this shop has managed to get thousands of sales from all over the world and act as an easy and efficient side hustle that lives on to this day.

           <h1>MY FIRST BRAND<h1>
            <p>
             Piggybacking off of Ryno's Tees, at the age of 22 I decided I wanted to start my own skateboard brand, where I would design all sorts of skateboard gear and sell it online and locally.
              <br></br>
              I've been running this brand myself since March of 2019. I do things like design the products, package and shipping, create marketing content, run socials, and quite frankly everything else involved in running a business.
              <br></br>
              The brand has gained traction across Illinois and California, and is still expanding its reach. I've sold products in reputable skate shops as well as online and in-person, managing to bring in thousands of sales.

           <h1>A NEW REALM<h1>
            <p>
             When I first learned about NFTs, I felt like it was right in my wheelhouse as I'm a big fan of both blockchain and digital art. The technology was new to me, and I knew it would be difficult to create an entire NFT project myself, but I was determined to see it through on the chance my project finds success.
              <br></br>
              I created and launched SK8 RATZ NFTs in 2022, using online digital marketing to create buzz and generate sales. On launch day the sales started rolling in, but unfortunately the project never fully minted out. 
              <br></br>
              It was a bad time in the market, but the project still turned out pretty kickass. You can find out more about it on the 'NFTs' section of my portfolio.
